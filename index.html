      <h1>Why is Visualization Effective?</h1>
      <p>Visualization is effective because it allows people to grasp the truth in data because they can see it.
      Without being able to actually see data, the human brain plays tricks on peoples
    initial thoughts on raw data. The example Cairo shares
  provides the responses of students to test scores. In this example, the students are upset when the class
test average is a 72 out of 100 while their moods improve when the average is a 96 out of 137. This shows the
  tricks raw numbers can play on the human mind wihtout visualizations because the ladder score was actually
  a lower percentage than the first. This problem can be applied to all raw data based on proportion and
can be easily solved just by putting the data into a certain visualization. </p>

      <h1>Effective Ways to Encode Data for Perceptual Tasks</h1>
      <p>The first suggestion for encoding data for perceptual tasks that Cairo
      recommends is to think about the tasks or tasks you want to enable. Thinking about what you want to display
    allows you to grasp a deeper understanding of the plot that you need. Some plots are more
  effective in comparing while others are better at showing relationships so to know which one to chose, you need to understand
what you are trying to accomplish. The next suggestion Cairo makes is to try different graphs. One graph does not always accomplish
the entirety of your goal. Therefore you might need both specific and general data plots or different variances in the
  set up of your x and y axis. The next step would be arranging the data. Maybe you use buttons to change between data plots or
  other options that increase the ability of the viewer to see the point you are making easier.

      <h1>Trade-Offs that Cairo Pushes for Consideration When Building Visualizations</h1>
      <p>One example of a trade-off that Cairo pushes is that sometimes you have to sacrifice some of the beauty input
      certain visualizations in order to make them more clear or sacrifice some clarity in order to make the data presentation prettier.
      Another trade-off is cutting down complex data in order to make a more easily understandable plot.
      For example, one could calculate an average depending on the relationship between the two variables.
      This would create simpler data and sometimes the simplest data is the most clear. On the other hand
     the data might be too simple to show patterns. If this is the case the data visualizer would need
     to expand the data portrayed and make things a little more complicated.
